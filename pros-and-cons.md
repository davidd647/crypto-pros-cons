## Crypto as it relates to BTC:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Pros:</td>
    <td>Cons:</td>

  <tr>

    <td>More difficult to convince people to use (the Romans forced use of their currency under threat of violence)</td>

    <td>Possibly more stable than the USD</td>
    <td>More volatile than holding assets (stocks/real estate)</td>

        <li>SHA-1 (2^160) was considered obsolete in 2011</li>
        <li>SHA-2 (2^256)… when it becomes obsolete, then so does the crypto built on it, right?</li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>If you could crack SHA-1 in 2011, and now crypto uses SHA-2… it should take about… 87 years, right?</li>
        <li>But if SHA-0 was trivial in 2008, and SHA-1 was unsafe in 2011… maybe that trajectory is only for generalized computing? So maybe SHA-cracking has its own specific type of machine?</li>
        <li>But maybe that kind of machine will only be doubling processor ability once every two years, still? </li>

    <td>- Moore’s law - density of transistors in a circuit doubles about every two years…</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>- If I haven’t really ‘gotten it’ after this much research, what are the chances $0.5T USD worth of investors actually ‘get it’? I feel like it's a low percentage. Adds volatility FOR SURE.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>- Seem to have people who talk about it like a religion online - which could increase its value…</td>
    <td>- Religions can be unpredictable sometimes.</td>
  </tr>

## Crypto, but specifically non-BTC:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>ETH - smart contracts create opportunity for something amazing</td>
    <td>Increased complexity and volatility</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>- Digital gold ties crypto currency to gold</td>
    <td>- But then the crypto will be used to buy gold, and that could possibly reduce the supply and increase the supply of gold…  I guess it’s fine for transferring things over long distances somewhat slowly (relative to most internet transfers)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
